# Unsupervised-Machine-Learning-and-Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of the project
A large investment bank is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. They have requested that our company create a report that includes cryptocurrencies that are on the trading market be grouped together to create a classification system for this new investment. We had to process the data to fit the machine learning models. Understanding there is no know output, we made the decision to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, the decision to use clustering algorithm was established. To demonstrate our analysis, we will use data visualizations to share the findings with the board.
